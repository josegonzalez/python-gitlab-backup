# Important notice regarding filed pull requests

This project already fills my needs, and as such I have no real reason to continue it's development. This project is otherwise provided as is, and no support is given.

I will attempt to review pull requests at _my_ earliest convenience. If I am unable to get to your pull request in a timely fashion, it is what it is. This repository does not pay any bills, and I am not required to merge any pull request from any individual.

If you wish to jump my personal priority queue, you may pay me for my time to review. My rate is $200 an hour - minimum 1 hour - feel free contact me via my github email address if you want to go this route.
